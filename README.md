# Interesting-Libraries-Packages
> Python Packages are a set of python modules, while python libraries are a group of python functions aimed to carry out special tasks. In this article, we are going to discuss some of the interesting libraries and packages.
**NOTE**: Some of these code may not work in **Python 2**. Hence I strongly recommend you to try them in **Python 3**.
